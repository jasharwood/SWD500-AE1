# About My Project

![Dogue Logo](images/dogue.png "Dogue Logo")

"Dogue." is a high-end/luxury dog fashion website which utilises a minimalist design trend. The site was developed using HTML5, SCSS, CSS3 and Javascript and has 6 pages; a landing page, product page, blog page, contact page, accessories page and a meet the designers page. The site utilises simplicity, a minimal colour palette and plenty of whitespace. The site aims to solve the issue of a lack of luxury dog fashion available online.
